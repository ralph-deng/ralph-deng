- 👋 Hi, I’m Ralph and over 50. Any "old" man/woman like me is still learning new things every single day?
- 👀 I’m interested in creating new things
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning react.js, node.js, rust, python, laravel and etc., and trying new tools like gatsby, svelte, typescript, tailwindcss and docker.  
- 💞️ I’m looking for remote development jobs and friends
- 📫 You can contact me at i.am.ralph.deng [at] gmail.com
